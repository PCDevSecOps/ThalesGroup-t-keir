    "Yann LeCun. Yann Andr\u00e9 LeCun is a French computer scientist working primarily\nin the fields of machine learning, computer vision, mobile robotics, and\ncomputational neuroscience. He is the Silver Professor of the Courant\nInstitute of Mathematical Sciences at New York University, and Vice President,\nChief AI Scientist at Facebook. He is well known for his work on optical\ncharacter recognition and computer vision using convolutional neural networks\n(CNN), and is a founding father of convolutional nets. He is also one of the\nmain creators of the DjVu image compression technology (together with L\u00e9on\nBottou and Patrick Haffner). He co-developed the Lush programming language\nwith L\u00e9on Bottou. LeCun received the 2018 Turing Award, together with Yoshua\nBengio and Geoffrey Hinton, for their work on deep learning. The three are\nsometimes referred to as the \"Godfathers of AI\" and \"Godfathers of Deep\nLearning\". Contents. 1 Life 2 Awards and honors 3 References 4 External links\nLife. Yann LeCun at the University of Minnesota, 2014 Yann LeCun was born at\nSoisy-sous-Montmorency in the suburbs of Paris in 1960. His name was\noriginally spelled Le Cun from the old Breton form Le Cunff \u2013 meaning\nliterally \"nice guy\" \u2013 and was from the region of Guingamp in northern\nBrittany. He received a Dipl\u00f4me d'Ing\u00e9nieur from the ESIEE Paris in 1983, and\na PhD in Computer Science from Universit\u00e9 Pierre et Marie Curie (today\nSorbonne University) in 1987 during which he proposed an early form of the\nback-propagation learning algorithm for neural networks. In 1988, he joined\nthe Adaptive Systems Research Department at AT&T; Bell Laboratories in\nHolmdel, New Jersey, United States, headed by Lawrence D. Jackel, where he\ndeveloped a number of new machine learning methods, such as a biologically\ninspired model of image recognition called Convolutional Neural Networks, the\n\"Optimal Brain Damage\" regularization methods, and the Graph Transformer\nNetworks method (similar to conditional random field), which he applied to\nhandwriting recognition and OCR. The bank check recognition system that he\nhelped develop was widely deployed by NCR and other companies, reading over\n10% of all the checks in the US in the late 1990s and early 2000s.[citation\nneeded] In 1996, he joined AT&T; Labs-Research as head of the Image Processing\nResearch Department, which was part of Lawrence Rabiner's Speech and Image\nProcessing Research Lab, and worked primarily on the DjVu image compression\ntechnology, used by many websites, notably the Internet Archive, to distribute\nscanned documents.[citation needed] His collaborators at AT&T; include L\u00e9on\nBottou and Vladimir Vapnik. After a brief tenure as a Fellow of the NEC\nResearch Institute (now NEC-Labs America) in Princeton, NJ, he joined New York\nUniversity (NYU) in 2003, where he is Silver Professor of Computer Science\nNeural Science at the Courant Institute of Mathematical Science and the Center\nfor Neural Science. He is also a professor at the Tandon School of\nEngineering. At NYU, he has worked primarily on Energy-Based Models for\nsupervised and unsupervised learning, feature learning for object recognition\nin Computer Vision, and mobile robotics. In 2012, he became the founding\ndirector of the NYU Center for Data Science. On December 9, 2013, LeCun became\nthe first director of Facebook AI Research in New York City, and stepped down\nfrom the NYU-CDS directorship in early 2014. In 2013, he and Yoshua Bengio co-\nfounded the International Conference on Learning Representations, which\nadopted a post-publication open review process he previously advocated on his\nwebsite. He was the chair and organizer of the \"Learning Workshop\" held every\nyear between 1986 and 2012 in Snowbird, Utah. He is a member of the Science\nAdvisory Board of the Institute for Pure and Applied Mathematics at UCLA. He\nis the Co-Director of the Learning in Machines and Brain research program\n(formerly Neural Computation & Adaptive Perception) of CIFAR. In 2016, he was\nthe visiting professor of computer science on the \"Chaire Annuelle\nInformatique et Sciences Num\u00e9riques\" at Coll\u00e8ge de France in Paris. His \"le\u00e7on\ninaugurale\" (inaugural lecture) was an important event in 2016 Paris\nintellectual life. Awards and honors. LeCun is a member of the US National\nAcademy of Engineering, the recipient of the 2014 IEEE Neural Network Pioneer\nAward and the 2015 PAMI Distinguished Researcher Award.[citation needed] In\n2016, he was awarded Doctor Honoris Causa by the IPN in Mexico City. In 2017,\nLeCun declined an invitation to lecture at the King Abdullah University of\nScience and Technology in Saudi Arabia because he believed he would be\nconsidered a terrorist in the country in view of his atheism. In September\n2018, he received the Harold Pender Award given by the University of\nPennsylvania. In October 2018, he received a Doctor Honoris Causa degree from\nEPFL. In March 2019, LeCun won the Turing award, sharing it with Yoshua Bengio\nand Geoffrey Hinton. In September 2019, he received the Golden Plate Award of\nthe American Academy of Achievement.\n\n"
