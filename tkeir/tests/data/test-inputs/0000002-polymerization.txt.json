Contents. 1 Overview 2 Step-growth vs. chain-growth\npolymerization 2.1 Step-growth 2.2 Chain-growth 2.3 Photopolymerization 3\nPolymer ratio 4 See also 5 References Overview. In chemical compounds,\npolymerization can occur via a variety of reaction mechanisms that vary in\ncomplexity due to the functional groups present in the reactants and their\ninherent steric effects. In more straightforward polymerizations, alkenes form\npolymers through relatively simple radical reactions; in contrast, reactions\ninvolving substitution at a carbonyl group require more complex synthesis due\nto the way in which reactants polymerize. Alkanes can also be polymerized, but\nonly with the help of strong acids. As alkenes can polymerize in somewhat\nstraightforward radical reactions, they form useful compounds such as\npolyethylene and polyvinyl chloride (PVC), which are produced in high tonnages\neach year due to their usefulness in manufacturing processes of commercial\nproducts, such as piping, insulation and packaging. In general, polymers such\nas PVC are referred to as \"homopolymers,\" as they consist of repeated long\nchains or structures of the same monomer unit, whereas polymers that consist\nof more than one monomer unit are referred to as copolymers (or co-polymers).\nOther monomer units, such as formaldehyde hydrates or simple aldehydes, are\nable to polymerize themselves at quite low temperatures (ca. \u221280 \u00b0C) to form\ntrimers; molecules consisting of 3 monomer units, which can cyclize to form\nring cyclic structures, or undergo further reactions to form tetramers, or 4\nmonomer-unit compounds. Such small polymers are referred to as oligomers.\nGenerally, because formaldehyde is an exceptionally reactive electrophile it\nallows nucleophilic addition of hemiacetal intermediates, which are in general\nshort-lived and relatively unstable \"mid-stage\" compounds that react with\nother molecules present to form more stable polymeric compounds.\nPolymerization that is not sufficiently moderated and proceeds at a fast rate\ncan be very hazardous. This phenomenon is known as hazardous polymerization\nand can cause fires and explosions.\n\n"], "kg": [], "error": false, "tasks-info": [{"os": ["Linux", "34f872a9f26a", "5.8.0-48-generic", "#54~20.04.1-Ubuntu SMP Sat Mar 20 13:40:25 UTC 2021", "x86_64"], "hostname": "34f872a9f26a", "host": "172.18.0.3", "execution-date": "May 06 2021 12:40:23", "task-version": "1.0.0", "task-development-date": "2021/05", "task-name": "converter"}]}
