    "Enron. Enron Corporation was an American energy, commodities, and services\ncompany based in Houston, Texas. It was founded by Kenneth Lay in 1985 as a\nmerger between Lay's Houston Natural Gas and InterNorth, both relatively small\nregional companies. Before its bankruptcy on December 3, 2001, Enron employed\napproximately 29,000 staff and was a major electricity, natural gas,\ncommunications, and pulp and paper company, with claimed revenues of nearly\n$101 billion during 2000. Fortune named Enron \"America's Most Innovative\nCompany\" for six consecutive years. At the end of 2001, it was revealed that\nEnron's reported financial condition was sustained by an institutionalized,\nsystemic, and creatively planned accounting fraud, known since as the Enron\nscandal. Enron has become synonymous of willful corporate fraud and\ncorruption. The scandal also brought into question the accounting practices\nand activities of many corporations in the United States and was a factor in\nthe enactment of the Sarbanes\u2013Oxley Act of 2002. The scandal also affected the\ngreater business world by causing the dissolution of the Arthur Andersen\naccounting firm, which had been Enron's main auditor for years. Enron filed\nfor bankruptcy in the Southern District of New York in late 2001 and selected\nWeil, Gotshal & Manges as its bankruptcy counsel. It ended its bankruptcy\nduring November 2004, pursuant to a court-approved plan of reorganization. A\nnew board of directors changed the name of Enron to Enron Creditors Recovery\nCorp., and emphasized reorganizing and liquidating certain operations and\nassets of the pre-bankruptcy Enron. On September 7, 2006, Enron sold its last\nremaining subsidiary, Prisma Energy International Inc., to Ashmore Energy\nInternational Ltd. (now AEI).\n\n"
